        <div class="paragraphs">
          <p>
            Fireworks can produce an insane amount of colors and effects through
            the controlled combustion of different chemical compounds. Different
            elements can cause specific colors to be made and can also cause
            various effects in fireworks by emitting light and specific
            wavelengths when they are excited and then returning to their ground
            state through relaxation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fireworks make different colors and effects by using different
            chemical compounds that are selected by people called
            pyrotechnicians. A pyrotechnician is just a fancy word for
            describing people who are experts at working with fireworks. When
            the compounds are ingested, the heat causes the atoms that are in
            the compound to become excited, and the electrons in the outermost
            energy level jump to higher energy levels. When the electrons return
            to their ground state, they release energy in the form of light,
            which produces the vibrant colors that we all see and love.
          </p>
          <p>
            To explain further, excitation and relaxation are two really
            important processes that happen at the atomic and molecular level in
            fireworks and lead to the emission of light, which produces the
            colors and effects that we see. When the protactic mixture is
            ignited, heat and energy are released, causing the atoms in the
            compounds to become excited. In this excited state, the electrons
            that are in the outermost energy level jump to higher energy levels;
            this process is known as excitation.
          </p>

          <p>
            After the electrons are excited, they are in an unstable state and
            quickly return to their original energy level, releasing energy in
            the form of light. This process is called rexlation. The energy
            that's released in relaxation corresponds to a specific wavelength
            of light, which in turn determines the color of the light that's
            emitted.
          </p>
          <p>
            The specific color of light emitted depends entirely on the energy
            difference between the excited state and the ground state of the
            atom or molecule. For example, when copper compounds are excited,
            they emit blue light with a specific wavelength that corresponds to
            the energy difference between the excited and ground states of
            copper atoms.
          </p>
          <p>
            The specific colors that are made by fireworks do depend on the
            chemical composition of the compounds that are being used. For
            example, copper compounds make blue colors, while barium compounds
            make green colors. Stronium compounds make red colors, and sodium
            compounds make yellow colors.
          </p>

          <p>
            To add to that, fireworks can actually produce various effects too,
            like sparkles, crackles, and whistles. These effects are made by
            incorporating different elements into the compounds. For example,
            metals like aluminum and magnesium can be used to make sparkles,
            while carbon and sulfur can be used to create crackling sounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, by using different chemical compounds and adding
            different elements, pyrotechnicians can make a wide range of colors
            and effects in fireworks. The effects and colors are made by the
            excitation and relaxation of atoms as the electrons in the compounds
            jump to higher energy levels and then return to their ground state,
            which releases energy in the form of light and sound.
